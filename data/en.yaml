    "Professor of Psychoceramics (the study of cracked pots) at [Brown University](https://brown.edu/) since 1929. I am a world-renowned expert in my field with extensive experience in Archaic Greek Architectural Revetments in Connection with Ionian Philology. My research has been recognized with an Ig Nobel Prize for Interdisciplinary Research. I am known for my elusive nature, as I am frequently scheduled to lecture but rarely appear. I established the Josiah S. Carberry Fund 'in memory of my future late wife, Laura,' for the purchase of books 'of which I might or might not approve.'"
